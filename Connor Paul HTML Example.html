		<h3><u><center>Main Argument</center></u></h3>
			<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
			During the Renaissance time period the processes of making books, tapestries, and woodcuts were very time and resource consuming. Alongside this 
			fact, authors, especially those who were female, often found themselves having a hard time finding and getting in contact with audiences for their 
			work. The lack of women's rights, the slow printing process, the absence of a fast and easy way to produce copies, and not having the Internet all 
			played huge roles in slowing the spread of books, tapestries and woodcuts and many other forms of media. Modern digitalization and technology have 
			vastly increased the speed of book and tapestry making, allowed authors to find audiences more quickly, replaced woodcuts and created entirely new 
			forms of media.</p>

		<h3><u><center>Renaissance Literature</center></u></h3>
			<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
			Book making in the Renaissance time period was not an easy process. Creating a book took many hours of slow work, as well as a lot of money because 
			in the beginning of the Renaissance all books had to be hand written. To get a book made you would have to be a writer of high status or a very wealthy 
			individual that could afford the process. As you can imagine, there weren't many books in circulation at the time due to the difficulties of the 
			creation process. These issues created a need for a change.</p> 
			<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
			Around the year 1440 Gutenberg invented the printing press and literature drastically changed forever. The printing press allowed books to be made much 
			faster and much easier. Print shops began to pop up throughout Europe and authors began to produce more work. Although the printing press sped up the 
			process, certain authors still had a hard time reaching their intended audiences. Books were still expensive and it was harder for people of the middle 
			class to get ahold of them without the necessary funds to purchase one or have one made. Print shops also often only focused on popular authors at the 
			time unless someone requested a different book for himself or herself. This led to primarily male authors being the most published and most book 
			collections being held by the upper class. Authors that were searching for a middle class audience had a very hard time getting their work circulated 
			because there was no guaranteed way to get the writing to these people. Women authors especially had a hard time getting their work published because 
			during the Renaissance time period there were no women's rights and women were not treated the same as men. They were expected to tend to household 
			duties and entertain guests of the house, not work as writers. This led to many women being denied publication, or not writing at all. These women and 
			less popular authors needed to find a way to reach their audiences. </p>

			<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
			Overtime women, like Amelia Lanyer, Isabella Whitney, and Esther Inglis, figured out solutions to their audience problems. Women authors in the Renaissance 
			began to focus their writing on flattery, dedications, and widely known subjects. For example, Amelia Lanyer is well known for tailoring dedications in her 
			books in order to flatter certain political and wealthy figures; this is prominent in <i>Salve Deus Rex Judeorum</i> in the section <i>To the Queenes most Excellent 
			Majestie</i>. This encouraged these well known people to ask for copies to be made and distributed. Lanyer also used widely known topics such as Roman mythology 
			in order to give readers a frame of reference that most already knew about. People could better understand and interpret what she was writing and that 
			encouraged more people to want her books. Isabella Whitney liked to try and share connections with her readers. She published many written letters in which 
			she talks about her struggles as a woman in desperate need of help. This approach proved to be very helpful because thousands of people could relate to her 
			struggle and draw similarities between their lives and hers. This made Whitney's writing much more personal to the reader. She also took into consideration 
			the public taste of the times and used that knowledge combined with a satirical tone to produce poems and other literature that were amusing to read. 
			Esther Inglis found her niche in making personalizations and gift books with the help of her husband. She used her husband's career as a clerk in order to 
			get her talents circulated. When her husband would deliver something to someone of importance, he would give him or her a gift book made by Esther along 
			with some personalizations of whatever was being delivered. This allowed Esther's talents to spread throughout Europe. </p>

			<br>
			<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
			Other notable attempts at reaching audiences were made by men. For example, the famous Edmund Spenser was having trouble getting his works published and 
			circulated. In a bold move he created <i>The Shepheardes Calender</i> that mimicked the almanacs of the time and included woodcuts. Almanacs were widely popular 
			during the Renaissance time period, and by simply changing the look and feel of his work, Spenser was able to enter the mainstream and become more well 
			known.</p>

		<h3><u><center>The Effect of Modern Technology and Digitalization on Writing<center></u></h3>
		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
		Nowadays with the Internet, the search for an audience has drastically changed. Women and other writers no longer need to struggle to find an audience, they only 
		have to produce something and post it in the correct area. For example, there are thousands of websites and blogs geared towards women such as <a href="http://www.blogher.com/">BlogHer</a> and <a href="http://yourdream.liveyourdream.org/">Live 
		Your Dream Blogs For Women</a>. Here women talk about all aspects of life and share their experiences and views. Women like Valerie Maltoni and Tamar Weinberg were 
		able to become famous very quickly through online blogging. Other popular options women and authors have used are writing for online magazines, newspapers, and 
		journals. This approach allows writers to reach millions of people in a more professional style. No matter the approach taken, it is incredibly easy to become an 
		online writer.</p>
		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
		The reason it is so easy to become a writer and reach an audience by using the Internet is because the only things one needs to post online is some type of device 
		and an Internet connection. Both of these don't even need to be owned by the writer because it is easy to find public machines to access the Internet and even 
		easier to find a Wi-Fi connection. If writing things on the Internet doesn't interest an author that does not mean that they will not reach an audience. Devices 
		like the Kindle and apps like iBooks allow consumers to easily access and read thousands of different books and other literature media with the tap of a finger.</p>
		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
		Not only has the reading interface changed, but the book printing experience has changed as well. In the past writers had to go to a print shop, convince the 
		printer to buy one of his or her manuscripts, convince the printer to turn the manuscript into a physical book, and encourage the printer to print and sell this 
		book as soon as they could. The author would then most often be paid close to nothing, if anything at all; the print shop would receive all sales and profits. 
		This process was tedious, annoying and unfair and we can assume that because of this, many writers were denied publication or avoided it altogether. Nowadays 
		Amazon has changed the printing experience completely. A writer can go onto <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000664761">Amazon's publishing website</a>, upload a Word document of their book, collaborate with trained 
		professionals to edit the work, and pick out font styles and cover images. Once they are satisfied with the look and feel of their book, Amazon will have as 
		many copies made as the author wants and will even sell them on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon Marketplace</a>. The author will also receive most of the profits from the sale of his 
		or her book. All of these changes to the writing, printing, sharing, and publishing of a book have aided the spread and accessibility of literature in the 21st 
		century and have allowed anyone to become an author if they so desire.</p>

		<h3><u><center>Renaissance Tapestries<center></u></h3>
		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
		Tapestries were a very intricate form of textile art throughout the Renaissance time period. In simple terms, a tapestry is a large blanket like textile that 
		people hang on their walls, use as curtains, and/or use as a throw. During the Renaissance, tapestries were mostly used as decorative pieces to hang on the walls 
		while also providing a type of insulation to keep the house warm and to prevent echoes. Tapestry making was a very long and slow process that could take months 
		to finish. Due to their size and weave difficulty, tapestries were almost always made by more than one weaver at a time. Most of the time there were at least 
		five weavers working at a time, with some tapestries requiring thirty or more weavers. For this reason, there are no well-known names associated with tapestries, 
		only shop names or the names of the houses where they were found. For example, a set of four tapestries all depicting different hunting scenes is referred to as 
		the Devonshire Hunting Tapestries because they originally came from the estate of the Dukes of Devonshire. Another example of this unknown artist issue is a set 
		of seven tapestries all showing different scenes of a unicorn hunt; the set is referred to as the Unicorn Tapestries.</p>

		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
		Although there aren't records of famous tapestry weavers, that doesn't mean that people in the Renaissance didn't know about tapestries. Tapestries were widely 
		popular among the rich and religious officials. Renaissance tapestries were amazing works of art, and having one showed wealth and status. Some people even went 
		so far as to request their tapestry to be made with silver and gold-wrapped silk. The tapestry shops themselves did not have many problems reaching an audience 
		because once people saw a tapestry they wanted one. Although this is true, the middle class was mostly an untapped audience due to the cost of acquiring a tapestry. 
		All of this changed once the age of technology and digitalization came around.</p>	
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h3><u><center>The Effect of Modern Technology on Tapestries<center></u></h3>	
		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
		Nowadays tapestries are very different than what they used to be. Most tapestries today are made via screen-printing or someone painting a design on the surface 
		(painting a tapestry was actually a reason to be jailed during the Renaissance). Most tapestries are also no longer woven by hand and instead are woven with the 
		help of machines. Machines help the modern weaver complete the process much faster than in the past. If you think about a bed sheet, a tapestry is made the same 
		way today.</p>

		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
		The Internet has also helped tapestry weavers reach a wider audience. Modern technology has reduced the cost of the making process as well as the materials, which 
		makes tapestries relatively cheap. This allows everyone to be able to acquire a tapestry if they want one. The acquisition process has also changed as well. 
		Tapestry weavers use the Internet to display and sell their pieces. Online sites such as <a href="https://society6.com/">Society6</a> and <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> sell thousands of tapestries; some handmade and 
		some machine made and machine printed. Now people simply access the web, press buy, type in a credit card number and the tapestry they wanted shows up at their 
		front doorstep within days. The ease of this process allows tapestry companies and weavers to sell to everyone.</p>

		<h3><u><center>Renaissance Woodcuts<center></u></h3>
		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
		Visual images in the Renaissance became popular very quickly. This demand for visual images gave life to things like woodcuts, which became highly desired by both 
		readers and certain authors.  Woodcuts are a very individualized art form that served as beautiful epitexts when printers stamped the image into a book. Each woodcut 
		is one of a kind because every cut onto the wood is unique in its own way and will never be replicated. Even with woodcut templates and drawn images, woodcut artists 
		could never create an exact replica of another woodcut.</p>
		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
		The presence of a printed illustration encouraged people to buy books, so printers quickly started adding them to certain texts and authors started requesting specific 
		woodcuts to be used in their texts as well. These printed images made the texts much more valuable to the reader and the printer could have charged more for books that 
		included them. Woodcut artists did not have a hard time finding an audience at all, but they were not recognized for their work. Often times, woodcuts would be added to 
		books without any citation of who the original artist was. Other artist and printers would also make copies of original woodcuts and begin to use them. Nowadays copyright 
		laws prevent things like this from happening.</p>

		<h3><u><center>The Effect of Modern Technology on Woodcuts<center></u></h3>
		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
		In the 21st century humans as a whole upload and share over 1.8 billion images a day, making them a very important roll in the day-to-day lives of those living in developed 
		countries. Images are an ever-increasing part of life, and new technologies have been created in order to produce images in books. Images are now printed into books by 
		simply uploading the image into a document and having that printed with a modern printer. The need for woodcuts has vanished, and woodcutting has become a hobby of sorts. 
		Nowadays 3D printing and laser cutting have become the modern woodcut. 3D objects can be printed easily and laser cut images take no time at all. 3D printing and laser 
		cutting are also done completely by machines and humans don't even need to oversee the process. Although both are not, 3D objects and laser cut images could theoretically 
		be used in the same way that woodcuts were in the past. We don't use them like we once used woodcuts because modern printers do a way better job. </p>

		<h3><u><center>New Forms of Media Created by Modern Technology<center></u></h3>
		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
		Technology has created many new forms of media including videos and podcasts. These new forms of media have allowed people from all walks of life to share their views 
		and work with huge audiences in milliseconds. There is no telling what other forms of media are yet to come with the never-ending progression of technology.</p>
		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
		Like writing a book, or posting on a blog, there are a lot of people who use videos to get their points and ideas across. Videos are a great platform for communicating 
		ideas because words and audio are complemented with live images. These work hand in hand to offer viewers a better understanding of the subject. People like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JennaMarbles">Jenna Marbles</a> 
		have become famous through the use of video by posting about controversial issues, random thoughts and feelings, and general comedy. Websites like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> have allowed 
		anyone in the world to upload and watch videos at their own leisure. YouTube and videos in general have increased communication throughout the entire world.</p>

		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">(Pictured above: One of Jenna Marbles's famous videos.)</p>
		<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
		Podcasts are used for the same purposes as videos, however they do not have any images accompanying them. Podcasts are audio files posted onto the Internet on a website 
		or some type of forum. Podcasts are popular because people can listen to them on any device, and they may also be downloaded. This allows people to put certain podcasts 
		on mobile devices and MP3 players to listen to them on the go. Podcasts are often times used for more serious conversations, but as with everything, there are also 
		comedic podcasts and others less serious.</p>
